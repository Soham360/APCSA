    "# Question 1: Primitive Types vs Reference Types (Unit 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Situation: You are developing a banking application where you need to represent customer information. You have decided to use both primitive types and reference types for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Define primitive types and reference types in Java. Provide examples of each.\n",
    "- Primitive types represent basic data types in Java and are predefined by the language. They are not objects and do not have methods associated with them. They are stored directly in memory, and their values are accessed quickly.\n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "    int num = 10;\n",
    "    double pi = 3.14;\n",
    "    char letter = 'A';\n",
    "    boolean flag = true;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "- Reference types refer to objects in memory. They are created using classes or interfaces and store references (memory addresses) to objects. Reference types can have methods and other members associated with them. They are allocated memory in the heap.\n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "    String str = \"Hello\"; // String is a reference type\n",
    "    MyClass obj = new MyClass(); // MyClass is a class defined elsewhere\n",
    "    int[] array = new int[5]; // array is a reference type\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Explain the differences between primitive types and reference types in terms of memory allocation and usage in Java programs.\n",
    "- Primitive types store their values in memory and reference types store references to values in the heap. Primitive types have a limited memory size that depends on the type while reference variable are stored in the stack memory, while the object's data is stored in the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a method `calculateInterest` that takes a primitive `double` type representing the principal amount and a reference type `Customer` representing the customer information. Write the method signature and the method implementation. Include comments to explain your code."
