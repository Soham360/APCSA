    "- This FRQ was about comparing and finding the similarities between a secret word and a guessed word. This FRQ is basically the extremely popular game Wordle and I'm surprised it became as popular as it did being this simple. For this question, I had to go through a guessed word and give clues based on matching letters and if they're in the hidden word. This was very challenging for me and I had to google a few things (such as the charAt function) to make the program much a lot simpler. By using Classes, I managed to finish the Wordle game.\n",
