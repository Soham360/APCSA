# MCQ 2015 Corrections
### Question 10

For this question, you were supposed to identify which of the given options is NOT a valid declaration considering the provided interface and class declarations. I chose Option C, believing it was incorrect. My mistake was not understanding that a variable of a superclass type can reference an object of the subclass; in this case, TennisPlayer is a subclass of Athlete. The correct answer is Option D because a variable of type Student cannot reference an object of type Athlete as they are not directly related in the hierarchy. This is why the correct answer is Option D.

### Question 18

For this question, you were supposed to determine the output of the given statement `System.out.println(404 / 10 * 10 + 1);`. I chose Option E, believing it was correct but unfortunately, I was wrong. I thought Option E was correct because I assumed it involved floating point division and casting to an int as in `(int)(404.0 / 10 * 10 + 1)`. However, the operation involved integer division. The correct answer is Option D (401), as it accurately represents the result of integer division followed by multiplication and addition. This is why the correct answer is Option D.

### Question 31

For this question, I was supposed to determine the state of the board after executing a given code segment. I chose Option A, thinking it was correct but unfortunately, I was wrong. I made this choice because I misunderstood how the loops and conditions within the code were functioning together. The correct answer is Option E as it requires loops across the entire board with alternating checks for when rows and columns are even or odd. This is why the correct answer is Option E.

# MCQ 2015 Reflection
I performed well on this quiz, scoring 36 out of 39. The three mistakes I made were due to misunderstandings in class hierarchy, integer division, and loop functionality in code. These are areas I will focus on to improve my understanding and performance for future quizzes.
