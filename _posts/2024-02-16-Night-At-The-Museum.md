## Two Trimester focus planning
- My team and I used Night at the Museum to display our projects to parents and peers. We asked for feedback, and we received comments from many people. They told us what they liked, what they wanted to see more of, and what they didn't like. This feedback helps us improve and gives us ideas for what to work on next.

- According to the feedback, we plan to add a student page for them to check their grades. We will also try to improve the chatbot so that there isn't as much of a delay between responses. Also, we aim to create an upload feature for assignments. Regarding login, I'll work on adding profile pictures and updating profiles. I'll also work on the sign-out function clears all cookies and only allows admins to delete accounts.

## Blog / article on you and team
- The beginning of our presentation was mainly for our families, so me and my group explained a bit of code and what our project did, to to our parents. The next wave of people were CS students. We were presenting at 6:30 so a lot of people were there. Families and parents came to watch our project and learn more about what it did. ONe thing that I believe our group did well was we slightly changed our presentation based on the questions the people asked. For instance, one parent was really interested in our project and asked multiple 'techie' questions. So, different from the other guests, we started explaining more of our model, the code, and the frontend-backend connection process. He seemed satisfied with our project and he enjoyed it as well. On the other hand, there was a family with 2 girls who had no interest in computer science whatsoever. To match to their tastes and interests, we tried to make the game and presentation more enjoyable and we didn't explain the code as much. We showed a little bit of the data as part of the presentation but the girls seemed to enjoy our project and stayed for a whole ten minutes. There were a few things, though, that we could've one better in the presentation. One was that we didn't try to attract customers on our own. Next time, we should be more active and try attract customers. Another thing was that our model was a bit inaccurate, so even though it didn't hinder our presentation, it is something we must fix by next tri.

Here are some pictures of me and our group sharing and presenting our project to others. All of our audience member seemed very satisfied with our presentation and our project.

## Blog on event
1 project I saw within Computer Science that I liked was Soham, Aniket, and Colin's project Tangerines. They made a website that acts as a Canvas replacement. I liked how users could upload their assignment that teachers/admins had created and the teachers could then grade them. Their website looked good too (style wise) and a lot of their methods worked (i.e. flashcards). I did find some grows, such as a fully functional assignment process and the login. Overall, their presentation was good and I liked their project.

One artwork that I saw from N@TM outside of Computer Science was from AP Studio Art. I am not good at drawing, and I am always amazed when someone draws a really goo locking drawing. The artist for this artwork uses vivid and vibrant colors that pop out of the page and draws the viewers in. I like how the painting depicts a stone road in space. The planets look good and the artist adds lighting really well to their drawing.
