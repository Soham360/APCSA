## Two Trimester focus planning
- My team and I used Night at the Museum to display our projects to parents and peers. We asked for feedback, and we received comments from many people. They told us what they liked, what they wanted to see more of, and what they didn't like. This feedback helps us improve and gives us ideas for what to work on next.

- According to the feedback, we plan to add a student page for them to check their grades. We will also try to improve the chatbot so that there isn't as much of a delay between responses. Also, we aim to create an upload feature for assignments. Regarding login, I'll work on adding profile pictures and updating profiles. I'll also work on the sign-out function clears all cookies and only allows admins to delete accounts.

## Blog / article on you and team
- The beginning of our presentation was mainly for our families, so me and my group explained a bit of code and what our project did, to to our parents. The next wave of people were CS students. We were presenting at 6:30 so a lot of people were there. Families and parents came to watch our project and learn more about what it did. It was very crowded but not nearly as crowded as it could have been because we presented in Mr. Lopez's room. Towards the end of our time slot, we invited our friends to look at our project. They gave a lot of feedback gave up some improvements to make.

Here are some pictures of me and our group sharing and presenting our project to others. All of our audience member seemed very satisfied with our presentation and our project.

## Blog on event
- I really liked a project done by Tay, Ethan, Emaad, and Anthony. They created a website where you could see an American Sign Language word and try to copy it. They mentioned using AI to compare the user's hand sign with the actual word. The AI compares the color values of pixels from the sign image and the camera recording the user, giving a similarity score. They also had a login page, although I'm not sure why it's needed. The website looked nice, but I noticed some room for improvement, especially with darker skin tones and poor lighting affecting the AI's accuracy. Overall, their presentation was great, and I enjoyed their project.

- One artwork that I saw from N@TM outside of Computer Science was from Drawing and Painting. I am not good at drawing or painting so I always visit the Art classes to see what the creative students made. I saw a cool artpiece that was the headshot of Mr. Mortensen but it was cut in half. The right side was on the paper and the left side was recreated by drawing it.
