# [Pluto](https://github.com/Soham360/sturdy-fiesta/issues/12)
- Pluto is a web application designed for students, offering features like real-time information on the remaining time in the current class period, daily weather forecasts with clothing advice, teacher announcements, and an assignment planner.

# Reflection
I aim to contribute more sporadically, collaborate effectively as a scrum master, and delve deeper into automated deployment through scripting. Exploring advanced APIs like AWS or Github for data analysis is a goal, along with using commits for success prediction in live reviews. I plan to try crowd sourcing for at least one project, update my personal website with class projects, and participate in the student LinkedIn project. Additionally, I want to explore UI after a year focused on backend development with Spring/Flask/Django.
